_Junior web developer, ex ICT business support specialist._

I bring an analytical mindset and a results-driven approach to my work. Committed to continuous improvement, I am eager to refine my skills and contribute to innovative projects. Open to new opportunities, I am driven by the desire to gain valuable experiences and build a successful career in web development.

Currently I am:
- Learning new technologies such as Vue.js, PostgreSQL...
- Maintaining ongoing projects
- Mastering Laravel and implementing new features to my projects [lara-jobs](https://github.com/gitnjole/lara-jobs) and [quantum-leap](https://github.com/gitnjole/quantum-leap)
