I built a global music streaming server on a Raspberry Pi 5 using DietPi, Docker, and Nginx, turning a USB drive into a secure, web-accessible music library. This project blends Linux sysadmin skills (headless setup, SSH hardening, firewall) with web development (custom domain, reverse proxy and upcoming web interface), streaming tunes anywhere via orbita.website. I'm currently writing a detailed devlog, testing replicable solutions, and preparing to release all scripts and configs on GitHub.
