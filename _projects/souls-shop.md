This project started out as a simple Vue.js learner tutorial on making a webshop. Pivoted to making a Dark Souls III ring weight and effects calculator \| build planner.

# Feature wishlist

- **Changeable versions of rings**

In Dark Souls III, you can discover various 'versions' of rings, ranging from base to +3. Higher tier variants can significantly benefit a player build, thus it's always worth checking to see whether possessing them enhances your damage output or survivability.

I'll make it so you can click on a ring to alter its version, which will also update the sidebar values. If you go over +3, the loop will reset and you will be back at the base version.

- **Shuffle button**

A simple shuffle button that generates a randomly selected arrangement of four rings on the sidebar.

- **API implementation**

Ability to export your loadout or view specific ring data. Could be **handy**.
